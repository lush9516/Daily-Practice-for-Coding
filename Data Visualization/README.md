# Python_Basic_Visualization

This is a record of practice on data visualization using python.

This record mainly contains practice using `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this practice, `pandas`,`numpy`,`matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`packages are required.


#### Install packages

Personally, I recommend to use anaconda which is easy to manage the packages.
* [anaconda free download link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installing anaconda, you can easily install python packages in terminal. 
```
conda install package_name
```

#### Load packages
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyploy as plt
import seaborn
```

## General guidance
This practice contains basic data visualization methods, including line plot, bar plot, histogram plot, etc. 

For `seaborn` package, the main use for me is to plot heatmap.
