# Other techniques & practice

This is a record of my practice using python on other techniques, including Web scrapping, Regular expression, Wordcloud and etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For Web scrapping practice, `pandas` and `numpy` packages are required.

For Wordcloud practice, `wordcloud` packages are required.

For Regular experssion practice, `re` packages are required

#### Install packages

Personally, I recommend to use anaconda which is easy to manage the packages.
* [anaconda free download link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installing anaconda, you can easily install python packages in terminal. 
```
conda install package_name
```
