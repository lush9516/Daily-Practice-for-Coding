# Daily Practice for Coding

This is a record of all my coding practice including Data Manipulation, Data Structure and Algorithm, Data Visualization.

This is a list of all the practice:
* [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Manipulation%20Practice)
* [Data Structure and Algorithm](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/LeetCode_Algorithm%20and%20Data%20Structure)
* [Data Visualization](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Visualization) 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For Data Manipulation, `pandas` and `numpy` packages are required.

For Data Visualization, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` packages are required.

#### Install packages

Personally, I recommend to use anaconda which is easy to manage the packages.
* [anaconda free download link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installing anaconda, you can easily install python packages in terminal. 
```
conda install package_name
```
### General guidance

For Data Manipulation, there are practices about rewriting SQL queries in python, data manipulation using pandas and data manipulation using numpy.

For Data Visualization, there are practices about visualization using `matplotlib.pyplt` and `seaborn`.
